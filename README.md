</a> 

A React JS project powered with Vite where we can plan our expenses starting with a budget and we have a circular progressbar which will point us when our planned expenses are more than our budget.

### Main features:
- Edit and Delete any expenses by swiping them (to the right for editing and to the left for deleting them).
- Filter all the expenses by category (saving, groceries, home, leisure, etc.).
- Reset the app(delete all the info you input) and Edit the budget
